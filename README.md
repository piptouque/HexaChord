HexaChord is a java software dedicated to music analysis and composition through generalized Tonnetz representations. Check the [presentation web page](https://louisbigo.com/hexachord).

# Build

The whole project can be built with the software `ant`. Just run the command `ant` from the directory `HexaChord`. It will use the file `build.xml` to compile the whole project.

# Run

Once the project has been built, simply run the command `./run_HexaChord.sh`. You might have to give exec rights to the script (`chmod +x run_HexaChord.sh`) and also edit the path to Java.
